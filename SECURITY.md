# Security

Report suspected vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub’s security advisory form](https://github.com/hraness/slopcamera/security/advisories/new). Do not open a public issue for credential exposure, path escape, unsafe SVG output, archive extraction, subprocess containment, unbounded resource use, Gateway authority substitution, or MCP boundary failures.

Include the affected version, platform, command or API, minimal reproduction, expected boundary, observed result, and whether any secret or caller-owned media left the machine. Remove tokens, account identifiers, private paths, and proprietary media from the report.

Slopcamera’s local MCP server confines paths to one caller-selected root but is not an operating-system sandbox against concurrent same-user mutation. Vectorization is network-silent. Generation sends its prompt and explicitly supplied media directly to Vercel AI Gateway. Slopcamera reads `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` or `VERCEL_OIDC_TOKEN` from the process environment and never persists either value. The opt-in `--hosted` route instead sends the prompt to the pinned Hraness gateway with the device’s stored credits token and reads no Gateway credential; the gateway admits only the CLI’s model allowlist and charges only after a credits hold.

An explicitly imported workflow module is trusted Bun code with the authority of the current user. Review workflow modules before running them. Declarative graph compilation restricts operation nodes to the closed capability projection supplied by the host and rejects unsupported capabilities before executor or resource admission, but it does not sandbox the JavaScript that constructs the graph.

The macOS host can request Screen Recording, System Audio Recording, Camera,
Microphone, and Input Monitoring permissions. Its input-event metadata and
recordings can contain selected display pixels, system audio, camera video,
microphone audio, cursor movement, clicks, key activity, focused-input bounds,
display topology, and changed window snapshots. Typed text is captured only
when separately enabled, and secure fields are suppressed even then. Treat all
capture output as sensitive, obtain the required consent, and inspect it before
sharing or uploading it.

The [privacy guide](PRIVACY.md) describes captured data, local processing,
selected uploads, and how to handle sensitive artifacts.
