# Publish Slopcamera

GitHub Releases are canonical. A protected stable tag produces one verified package archive, GitHub provenance, and an immutable Release, then the same workflow publishes those exact bytes to npm through trusted publishing. npm is a downstream mirror. The new `@hraness/slopcamera` package has no dual-use content declaration or classification-based disclosure requirement. Its npm publisher must be configured for this exact new identity; settings on historical `@hraness/atet` do not carry over.

Start with [canonical GitHub publication](#publish-a-canonical-github-release).
The [npm publication](#publish-the-canonical-release-to-npm) follows automatically in the same workflow.
Slopcamera v3.2.4 is the first canonical Slopcamera release; these procedures publish each later version the same way, and no archive is advertised before its live acceptance.

## Publish a canonical GitHub release

Keep the source candidate separate from a verified public release. `apps/web/published-release.json` names the verified canonical Slopcamera release that the site and README advertise. Keep source installation as the public default until a Slopcamera archive passes live verification. Then update the installation surface and its verified release datum together.

1. Merge the new stable source through the current-head Required gate and complete the repository's local and native acceptance. From clean current `main`, run `bun run ./scripts/push-release-tag.ts <exact-stable-version>`. Its sole annotated-tag push follows owner, repository, protected-main, exact CI run/attempt/Required job, both live tag rulesets, immutable GitHub latest and monotonic remote-tag checks. It never publishes npm, moves a tag, or deletes a remote ref.
2. The protected tag workflow repeats owner and sender ID `894119`, repository ID `1310516748`, annotated tag, source ancestry and current-main workflow/helper closure checks. The read-only job runs the complete source gate, builds one `npm pack --ignore-scripts` archive, independently validates its bounded USTAR inventory and metadata, and exercises the exact archive in isolated Bun and npm consumers. Five official VTracer targets must pass before attestation. The menu-bar companion is built on macOS by source CI; it has no native packaging job in this archive release.
3. A checkout-free job reauthorizes the current run and loads only the byte-identical current-main/tagged release helper. It verifies the four-file handoff against the verification job's digests before requesting OIDC. Pinned `actions/attest` signs the archive, `npm-pack.json`, `release-manifest.json` and `SHA256SUMS`. `provenance.jsonl` carries the returned bundle. No package or product code runs with attestation or release credentials.
4. The dependent publisher independently verifies the five exact files, cryptographic provenance and hosted source/run/attempt identity. It creates an Actions-authored draft, uploads only missing matching assets, checks all provider names, sizes and digests, rechecks live source/authority and version ordering, then publishes immutable Latest. It never overwrites an asset or deletes/recreates a release. Discover existing drafts through the bounded authenticated release list, require one exact-tag match, and use its positive release ID for readback; GitHub may return 404 for a draft at the tag endpoint. Matching state from the same attempt is reconciled; a prior attempt's different manifest or bundle stops with its exact state rather than relabeling historical provenance.
5. Verify the live release, download its five assets into a fresh directory, and verify the archive before installation:

   ```sh
   gh release verify v<version> --repo hraness/slopcamera
   gh release download v<version> --repo hraness/slopcamera --dir <fresh-directory>
   gh release verify-asset v<version> <fresh-directory>/hraness-slopcamera-<version>.tgz --repo hraness/slopcamera
   gh attestation verify <fresh-directory>/hraness-slopcamera-<version>.tgz --repo hraness/slopcamera --signer-workflow hraness/slopcamera/.github/workflows/release.yml --signer-digest <source-sha> --source-digest <source-sha> --source-ref refs/tags/v<version> --deny-self-hosted-runners --bundle <fresh-directory>/provenance.jsonl
   ```

   Check every checksum against the downloaded bytes and bind the manifest to the verified source, tag and release attempt. Run `scripts/package-smoke.ts --archive <archive> --pack-json <npm-pack.json>` against the exact tagged source in an isolated consumer. A checksum or unsigned manifest alone is not provenance.
6. After live asset and installation acceptance, update the public release datum and installation references in a normal checked change, then verify Production HTML, Markdown and download targets. The one-command CLI install and update is `bun add --global https://github.com/hraness/slopcamera/releases/download/v<version>/hraness-slopcamera-<version>.tgz`; omit `--global` for an SDK dependency. Package and command names stay `@hraness/slopcamera` and `slopcamera`. Resolve Latest discovery to an immutable version before verification; do not install a mutable latest URL or pipe a downloaded script into a shell.

   If an update from a previous local archive reports Bun's `DependencyLoop`,
   use its [named tarball syntax](https://bun.com/docs/pm/cli/add#tarball-dependencies):
   prefix that same verified archive URL with `@hraness/slopcamera@` in the
   `bun add --global` command. Check `slopcamera --version` after the update.

The manifest has exactly schema `hraness-github-release-v1`, repository/name and numeric repository ID, package, stable version/tag, source SHA, release workflow/current authority SHA, numeric run ID/attempt, and archive name/bytes/SHA-256/SHA-512. Every file is bounded and regular; unexpected files, symlinks, traversal, unsafe packed configuration and inconsistent bytes reject. Native binaries are not added to this distribution without separately enumerated asset and installation proof. The capture shell and its release gates were removed in [PR #111](https://github.com/hraness/slopcamera/pull/111); the current companion's macOS source build was added in [PR #116](https://github.com/hraness/slopcamera/pull/116).

## Publish the canonical release to npm

npm publication is automatic. The same tag Release workflow that publishes the
immutable GitHub Release then runs `publish_npm`, which publishes the exact
canonical archive bytes to `@hraness/slopcamera` through npm trusted publishing
(OIDC) with npm provenance, and `admit_npm`, which verifies the public registry
copy against the canonical asset. No dispatch, staged approval, two-factor
prompt, or token is involved; Slopcamera is ordinary software and carries no
content-policy classification. Preserve account two-factor authentication and
the exact configured publisher; never substitute a long-lived publishing token.

`publish_npm` runs only after `publish` has verified immutable Latest. It checks
out no product source and installs no dependencies. It re-runs the owner and
current-main authority checks, loads the byte-identical current-main release
helper, downloads the attested five-file handoff by numeric artifact ID (so a
rerun of only the failed job still publishes the identical bytes), and admits it
through `github-release.ts npm-admit`: exact handoff bytes and trusted digests,
this run's source and tag, cryptographic provenance, and the published immutable
Latest release whose assets carry the same digests. The checkout-free USTAR and
packed-manifest reader then rejects any packed `tag`, non-canonical
`publishConfig`, or unsafe archive before the job requests OIDC.

Immediately before mutation the job scrubs ambient `npm_config_tag`, proves that
npm 11.19.0's clean default tag is `latest`, rehashes the archive, and reads the
registry version. An absent version must be newer than public `latest`; a
version that already publishes the identical SHA-512 integrity is an earlier
attempt of the same publication and completes without a second write; a
different integrity fails closed and is never overwritten. The only registry
mutation is equivalent to:

```sh
npm publish <attested-archive> \
  --@hraness:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org \
  --access public \
  --ignore-scripts \
  --provenance \
  --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org
```

It runs from a clean directory with separate empty user and global npm
configuration files and deliberately omits `--tag`, so npm keeps its built-in
monotonic-`latest` guard. The returned identity must match the archive
integrity exactly.

`admit_npm` checks out the verified tag read-only, downloads the immutable
GitHub asset and the registry archive, and compares them with
`npm-package-identity.ts` (complete content inventory, entry types, modes,
sizes and hashes; npm may re-encode transport bytes). It installs the exact
registry version in an isolated consumer, runs
`npm audit signatures --json --include-attestations --omit=dev`, and verifies
registry signatures plus the npm publish and SLSA attestations with
`npm-publish-authority.ts`, which binds the provenance to this repository, the
tag ref, the `push` event and the Release workflow. The isolated package smoke
runs against the registry archive. Those npm proofs are mirror acceptance; they
are not GitHub release authority. An npm write can succeed before its runner
reports failure, so rerun only the failed jobs and let the registry readback
reconcile the state; never republish a version or move `latest` backward.

The packed manifest must not contain a top-level `tag`, because npm gives that
field precedence over the command's explicit dist-tag. Its `publishConfig` must
contain exactly `access` and `registry`, with values `public` and
`https://registry.npmjs.org`. A scoped registry, proxy, authentication, tag,
provenance-file, or any other packed npm configuration is forbidden because npm
otherwise lets package metadata override its network and publication options.
The checkout-free publication parser and source/release identity parser both
require the exact eight-byte USTAR signature (`ustar\0` plus `00`) and
npm/node-tar's byte-475 prefix discriminator (zero means 130 prefix bytes;
nonzero means 155). Shared hostile fixtures keep both tar consumers
behaviorally aligned.

## Protect release tags without a sudo prompt

Keep two active repository rulesets matching `refs/tags/v*`. **Immutable
version tags** restricts update and deletion with an empty bypass list.
**Release tag creation** restricts creation only and gives immutable owner
`User` ID `894119` the sole always-bypass entry. Do not grant the generic
GitHub Actions integration, an administrator, a repository role, a team, or
another integration this bypass, and never combine creation with update or
deletion. This one-time provider setup lets the already-authenticated owner
create the exact release tag under standing task authority without a routine
GitHub sudo approval. Never create probe tags or move a version tag. The canonical GitHub gate is independent of optional npm mirroring.

See npm's documentation for [trusted
publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishers/).

## Configure trusted publishing

`@hraness/slopcamera` publishes only through one GitHub Actions trusted
publisher with this exact identity:

- organization or owner: `hraness`
- repository: `slopcamera`
- workflow filename: `release.yml`
- environment: `npm-release`
- allowed action: `npm publish`

The one-time owner setup (passkey or two-factor prompt) is:

```sh
npm trust github @hraness/slopcamera --repo hraness/slopcamera --file release.yml --environment npm-release --allow-publish --yes
npm trust list @hraness/slopcamera
```

Revoke any earlier relationship that names another workflow file or
environment with `npm trust revoke @hraness/slopcamera --id <trust-id>`.

The GitHub environment `npm-release` has administrator bypass disabled, the
sole protection rule `branch_policy`, and the sole deployment policy tag `v*`.
It has no required reviewers and no secrets. Only `publish_npm` may reference
this environment or request the npm OIDC token; `attest` holds the only other
`id-token: write`. Set package publishing access to **Require two-factor
authentication and disallow tokens**, remove traditional publishing tokens, and
never add an npm token to GitHub. Do not copy historical Atet classification
metadata or its disclosure requirement into the new package.

## Historical Atet publication

Atet's one-time npm bootstrap published `@hraness/atet@3.1.1` as
`hraness-atet-3.1.1.tgz`. That package used a dual-use declaration and a
classification-specific disclosure. The [retained publication record](https://github.com/hraness/atet/blob/7ec55465c00db47553f2ac9d79181c6be01c9cc1/docs/publishing.md#bootstrap-the-npm-package)
describes the original commands and checks. Those requirements and artifacts
belong to the historical package; they do not describe Slopcamera's package or
prove that its registry publisher has been configured.

Preserve the historical tags, archives, package versions, attestations and
receipts unchanged. A GitHub repository redirect does not rename their package
contents or archive filenames. Never recreate an old artifact under a new name
and call it the original publication.
